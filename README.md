# VBA-Challenge
Bootcamp Homework #2
Matthew Cullen, CFA

Files Submitted:
I submitted several files.  Homework 2 code is the VBA Script.  I attached screen shots in 2 formats across 4 files.  I submitted screen shots for the first page individually as jpeg files for each year (these are the three jpeg files that correspond to 2016, 2015, and 2014.)  I also pasted Excel print screens for each year in a word file that are easier to read.  I did not do the bonus challenge.
