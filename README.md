# VBA-Challenge
Bootcamp Homework #2
Matthew Cullen, CFA

Files Submitted:
I submitted several files.  Homework 2 code is the VBA Script.  I attached screen shots in 2 formats across 4 files.  I submitted screen shots for the first page individually as jpeg files for each year (these are the three jpeg files that correspond to 2016, 2015, and 2014.  If you want more screen shots, please let me know.  For the first year by my estimate it would have been 100 screenshots!)  I also pasted Excel print screens for each year in a word file that are easier to read.  I did not do the bonus challenge and thought this was a very stern test for VBA as we had not covered a lot of the relevant examples in class.  That said, by diagnosing the problem before starting to code, a lot of hard work and testing, and consulting with my tutor and teaching team, I felt like I had a good handle on the situation by the end!
